now lets come to the logic what did i learn or lets say what did you teach me apart from styling using bootstrap, how did you come about the logic

Key Concepts Covered:

React State Management (useState)
---------------------------------
we used the useState hook to manage the state of the app.

We have two pieces of state: tasks and task.

tasks is an array that stores the list of tasks the user adds.

task holds the current value entered in the input field.

const [tasks, setTasks] = useState([]);
const [task, setTask] = useState("");


-------------------------------------
Handling Form Inputs

In the app, you learned how to capture user input from a text field and store it in the componentâ€™s state. This was done with the onChange event handler

<input
  type="text"
  className="form-control"
  placeholder="Enter a task"
  value={task}
  onChange={(e) => setTask(e.target.value)}
/>

What did you learn?

How to listen to user input via event handlers.
How to capture and update the input value using onChange and state.

--------------------
Rendering Lists Dynamically

What did you learn?

How to render lists dynamically in React.
How to use the map() function to loop over arrays and generate JSX elements.
---------------------------------------

Handling Events (Adding and deleting tasks)

Adding
How does it work?

setTasks([...tasks, task]) adds the new task to the array without modifying the original array (tasks), ensuring immutability.
setTask("") resets the input field to an empty string after the task is added.

deleting

(_, i) => i !== index
The callback function has two parameters:

The first parameter (_) represents the current task in the array, but since it's not used in this case, it's named _ to indicate it's ignored.
The second parameter (i) is the index of the current task in the array.
What is this doing?

The callback checks if the index i of the current task is not equal to the index of the task we want to delete.
If i !== index is true, the task will be included in the new array.
If i === index is false (i.e., it's the task to be deleted), that task will not be included in the new array.
