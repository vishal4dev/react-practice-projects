  ass (Syntactically Awesome Stylesheets) is a preprocessor scripting language that is compiled into CSS (Cascading Style Sheets)

  Sass adds functionality like variables, nesting, and mixins, which are not available in pure CSS.

    Sass needs to be compiled: The .scss or .sass files are not directly understood by browsers. You need a Sass compiler to convert them into regular .css files.
